                            in <a href="https://www.msg.com/madison-square-garden">Madison Square Garden</a>, 
                            according to people<br>with knowledge of the situation not authorized to speak publicly. The Lakers 
                            sent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis">Anthony Davis</a>, young guard Max Christie and their 
                            2029 first-round<br>draft pick to<a href="https://www.mavs.com/">Dallas Mavericks</a> for <a href="https://en.wikiped
                            ia.org/wiki/Luka_Don%C4%8Di%C4%87">Luka Doncic</a> and forwards Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris. The 
                            Lakers also sent second-year guard Jalen Hood-Schifino 
                            <br>to the Utah Jazz, who got second-round picks from the Lakers (their 2025 pick from the Clippers) 
                            and Mavericks to facilitate the trade.

                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp;According to people with knowledge of the trade talks not authorized to discuss the deal, 
                            it occurred without the knowledge any of players,<br>including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James">Lebron James</a>, and was done almost 
                            completely between general managers Rob Pelinka of the Lakers and Nico Harrison, who joined
                             the<br>Mavericks after being a longtime Nike executive. The two have an extensive history 
                             dating to Kobe Bryant&apos;s time with the sneaker brand.

                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp;Questions about the future of James, who holds a no-trade clause and can opt out of a 
                            $52.6-million player option and become a free agent after<br>this season, are being asked by executives 
                            on rival teams.
                        </p>

                            &emsp;&emsp;In Doncic, the Lakers have acquired one of the premier on-ball players in the world. He&apos;s
                             a five-time All-Star, a five-time All-NBA player who led<br>the Mavericks to the NBA Finals a season ago. 
                             He&apos;s averaging 28.1 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.8 assists this season and is recovering from a calf<br>injury
                              that&apos;s kept him out since Christmas. He&apos;s expected back before the All-Star break.
                        </p>

                            &emsp;&emsp;Davis, an NBA champion with the Lakers in 2020 and in the middle of another All-Star season, 
                            rejoins an assistant from that championship team<br>in Mavericks coach Jason Kidd and, like Pelinka, has 
                            extensive ties with Harrison through Nike. Davis joins a Mavericks team that has Kyrie Irving,<br>Klay Thompson 
                            and an emerging two-way player in Christie, who has played the best basketball of his career.
