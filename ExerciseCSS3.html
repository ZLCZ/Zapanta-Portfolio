            &emsp;&emsp;The deal happened after the <a href="https://www.nba.com/lakers/" target="_blank">Los Angeles Lakers</a> beat the New York 
            Knicks <a href="https://www.bing.com/sportsdetails?q=Los%20Angeles%20Lakers%20vs%20New%20York%20Knicks&gameid=SportRadar_Basketball_NBA_2024_Game_1ea83c1d-d4a8-462d-8b7b-e204d0e0ac6e&league=Basketball_NBA&scenario=GameCenter&intent=Game&iscelebratedgame=True&TimezoneId=Singapore%20Standard%20Time&sport=Basketball&team=SportRadar_Basketball_NBA_2024_Team_583ec70e-fb46-11e1-82cb-f4ce4684ea4c&team2=SportRadar_Basketball_NBA_2024_Team_583ecae2-fb46-11e1-82cb-f4ce4684ea4c&venueid={%22id%22:%22SportRadar_Basketball_NBA_2024_Venue_583152aa-de75-5bea-ac92-ac5b8a51f9f9%22}:version-1&segment=sports&isl2=true&" target="_blank">Lakers 128 - Knicks 112</a>
            in <a href="https://www.msg.com/madison-square-garden" target="_blank">Madison Square Garden</a>, 
            according to people<br>with knowledge of the situation not authorized to speak publicly. The Lakers 
            sent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis" target="_blank">Anthony Davis</a>, young guard Max Christie and their 
            2029 first-round<br>draft pick to <a href="https://www.mavs.com/" target="_blank">Dallas Mavericks</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don%C4%8Di%C4%87" target="_blank">Luka Doncic</a> and forwards Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris. The 
            Lakers also sent second-year guard Jalen Hood-Schifino 
            <br>to the Utah Jazz, who got second-round picks from the Lakers (their 2025 pick from the Clippers) 
            and Mavericks to facilitate the trade.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;According to people with knowledge of the trade talks not authorized to discuss the deal, 
            it occurred without the knowledge of any players,<br>including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James" target="_blank">LeBron James</a>, and was done almost 
            completely between general managers Rob Pelinka of the Lakers and Nico Harrison, who joined
            the<br>Mavericks after being a longtime Nike executive. The two have an extensive history 
            dating to Kobe Bryant’s time with the sneaker brand.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;Questions about the future of James, who holds a no-trade clause and can opt out of a 
            $52.6-million player option and become a free agent after<br>this season, are being asked by executives 
            on rival teams.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;In Doncic, the Lakers have acquired one of the premier on-ball players in the world. He’s
            a five-time All-Star, a five-time All-NBA player who led<br>the Mavericks to the NBA Finals a season ago. 
            He’s averaging 28.1 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.8 assists this season and is recovering from a calf<br>injury
            that’s kept him out since Christmas. He’s expected back before the All-Star break.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;Davis, an NBA champion with the Lakers in 2020 and in the middle of another All-Star season, 
            rejoins an assistant from that championship team<br>in Mavericks coach Jason Kidd and, like Pelinka, has 
            extensive ties with Harrison through Nike. Davis joins a Mavericks team that has Kyrie Irving,<br>Klay Thompson 
            and an emerging two-way player in Christie, who has played the best basketball of his career.
