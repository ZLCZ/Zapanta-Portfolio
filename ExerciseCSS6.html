                <h3>The deal happened after the <a href="https://www.nba.com/lakers/" target="_blank">Los Angeles Lakers</a> beat the New York Knicks 
                <a href="https://www.bing.com/sportsdetails?q=Los%20Angeles%20Lakers%20vs%20New%20York%20Knicks&gameid=SportRadar_Basketball_NBA_2024_Game_1ea83c1d-d4a8-462d-8b7b-e204d0e0ac6e&league=Basketball_NBA&scenario=GameCenter&intent=Game&iscelebratedgame=True&TimezoneId=Singapore%20Standard%20Time&sport=Basketball&team=SportRadar_Basketball_NBA_2024_Team_583ec70e-fb46-11e1-82cb-f4ce4684ea4c&team2=SportRadar_Basketball_NBA_2024_Team_583ecae2-fb46-11e1-82cb-f4ce4684ea4c&venueid={%22id%22:%22SportRadar_Basketball_NBA_2024_Venue_583152aa-de75-5bea-ac92-ac5b8a51f9f9%22}:version-1&segment=sports&isl2=true&" target="_blank">Lakers 128 - Knicks 112</a> in <a href="https://www.msg.com/madison-square-garden" target="_blank">Madison Square Garden</a>, according to people with knowledge of the situation not authorized to speak publicly. The Lakers sent 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis" target="_blank">Anthony Davis</a>, young guard Max Christie and their 2029 first-round draft pick to 
                <a href="https://www.mavs.com/" target="_blank">Dallas Mavericks</a> for 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don%C4%8Di%C4%87" target="_blank">Luka Doncic</a> and forwards Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris.
                </h3>
                <h3>Additional Context: The trade came as a shock to many fans who were not expecting the Lakers to make such a big move. This trade is seen as a bold decision that 
                    could redefine the Lakers' chances of winning another championship in the near future.</h3>

            <div class="column two">
                <h3>According to people with knowledge of the trade talks not authorized to discuss the deal, 
                it occurred without the knowledge of any players, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James" target="_blank">LeBron James</a>, 
                and was done almost completely between general managers Rob Pelinka of the Lakers and Nico Harrison, who joined
                the Mavericks after being a longtime Nike executive. The two have an extensive history dating to Kobe Bryant’s time with the sneaker brand.</h3>
                <h3>Insights: The deal happened quickly and without much prior discussion with the players, which raised some concerns among the Lakers’ fanbase. 
                    However, many believe this could be a strategic move for the future of the team, especially with Luka Doncic's potential to lead the team to success.</h3>

            <div class="column three">
                <h3>Questions about the future of LeBron James, who holds a no-trade clause and can opt out of a 
                $52.6-million player option and become a free agent after this season, are being asked by executives 
                on rival teams.</h3>
                <h3>In Doncic, the Lakers have acquired one of the premier on-ball players in the world. He’s
                a five-time All-Star, a five-time All-NBA player who led the Mavericks to the NBA Finals a season ago. 
                He’s averaging 28.1 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.8 assists this season and is recovering from a calf injury
                that’s kept him out since Christmas. He’s expected back before the All-Star break.</h3>
                <h3>Davis, an NBA champion with the Lakers in 2020 and in the middle of another All-Star season, 
                rejoins an assistant from that championship team in Mavericks coach Jason Kidd and, like Pelinka, has 
                extensive ties with Harrison through Nike. Davis joins a Mavericks team that has Kyrie Irving, Klay Thompson 
                and an emerging two-way player in Christie, who has played the best basketball of his career.</h3>
